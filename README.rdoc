= TestFs

== Description

Test FS is a gem that's used in your testing environment to create a temporary directory and file structure so that you don't have to muck around with mocking out filesystem calls or have a specific directory structure as part of your project.  It's easy to set up and easy to destroy.

== Installation

    sudo gem install reagent-test-fs --source=http://gems.github.com

== Usage

TestFS is designed to be used from within your Unit Tests to set up a directory and then tear it down immediately after your test runs:

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'test/unit'
    require 'test_fs'
    
    class LameExample
      
      def initialize(root)
        @root = root
      end
        
      def magic?
        File.exist?("#{@root}/path/file.txt")
      end
      
    end
    
    class LameExampleTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
      
      def setup 
        @fs = setup_filesystem do |root|
          root.dir 'path' do |p|
            p.file 'file.txt'
          end
        end
      end
      
      def teardown
        @fs.destroy!
      end
      
      def test_magic
        lame_example = LameExample.new(@fs.path)
        assert_equal true, lame_example.magic?
      end
      
    end
    
That's just a simple example, you can have parallel directories and nest as deep as you need:

    setup_filesystem do |root|
      root.dir 'app' do |app|
        app.dir 'controllers'
        app.dir 'helpers
        app.dir 'models'
      end
      root.dir.dir 'config' do |config|
        config.file 'database.yml'
        config.file 'environment.rb'
        config.dir  'environments' do |environments|
          environments.file 'test.rb'
          environments.file 'development.rb'
      end
    end

== TODO

* Teardown of filesystem is manual (e.g. @fs.destroy!) - this should be hooked into standard Test::Unit teardown if there is a filesystem that was created as part of the test
* This doesn't handle the creation of multiple filesytems in a single test run - new filesystems will clobber existing ones
* The <tt>file</tt> method just uses FileUtils.touch to create a file, it needs a way to easily get content into the file
